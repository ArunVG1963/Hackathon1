Color selection is a key component to any design process, General Knowledge Quiz requires to show bright beautifull colors. The artwork and color selection thus played a integral part in the design of this project as they were essential in creating a welcoming and appropriate page for the end user and their specific needs.

So, keeping in mind the combination of blue and green, theme of the website was set accordingly. I was able to determine an appropriate color scheme that is aesthetically pleasing whilst being both calming and engaging.

## Fonts

As with color, font was a big consideration for ensuring a positive user experience whilst visiting the page.
Lato and Oswald fonts were selected for the project, and implemented via Google Fonts using a direct import code within the style.css file.


## Features
#### General Features
In order to fulfil the criteria the page consists of various sectioned information each with a variety of links, resources and other elements that contribute to a positive user experience.

Within this section I have included two buttons that present easy to navigate options for the user to access the relevant section of the page for their needs.
